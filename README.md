# Basic HTML Portfolio Website
Welcome to my first project - a basic portfolio website created using HTML!

# Description
This project is a simple portfolio website that I built as my introductory project into web development. It's a reflection of my early learning journey and showcases my familiarity with HTML. While it might be basic, it marks a significant milestone for me as I begin my exploration of the web development world.

# Explore
Feel free to explore the website to learn a bit about me, my interests, and my aspirations. The website's structure is intentionally kept minimal, focusing on the core HTML concepts I've learned.
